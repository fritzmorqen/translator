When i first came to Odessa, i had the notion of that i would handle this just fine by myself, but truth to be told i was totally lost and almost confined myself to my hotel room, by pure luck and extenssive google searching i came across Taya. She totally changed my life here in Odessa, all of a sudden all doors to a fantastic time and vacation in Odessa opened, she is a fantastic guide and knows everything that is worth to be knowing about the city and above all she genuinly cares about your well being.</p>

Hi Taya<br />
I would like to thank you for all your help on my visit to Odessa in September of 2013. Right from meeting me at the airport to when I left 10 days later your services were great. Eugene the interpreter you got for me was excellent. He and I had a very good time and he showed me all of the city. I have to thank him very much. He was very professional at all times. I would recommend him to anyone. On my return to Odessa you can be sure I will call you again. Thanks ever so much.</p>

To Whom It May Concern;</p>
<p>This letter is to inform anyone who seeks the services of an interpeter. That Taya and her team took very good care of all of my business needs. From traveling throughout Ukraine, assisting in setting up my business meetings, bookings etc. Interpeting is not the only services this lady has done for me. I would not be able to handle such business task in Ukraine without this team. From business meetings during the day and leisure time in the evening. If your looking for on time professional service you can trust, if you care about what your clients think of you and the people you hire. Than I highly recommend this agency. Thank you Taya and I look forward to seeing you soon!</p>
